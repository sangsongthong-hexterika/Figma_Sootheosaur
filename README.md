# Figma Project: Sootheosaur

## Disclaimer

This document outlines a checklist for my personal project showcasing my skills in Figma UI/UX design. The project is based on a fictional spa resort called Sootheosaur, designed to simulate a real-world client request for a responsive spa website.

The project includes:

+ Account registration and login flows
+ A reservation table system
+ A responsive mobile interface that differs from the desktop version

Currently, this project focuses only on the design, not the development or coding.

This is unpaid work, created solely to build a strong portfolio and demonstrate my detailed, organized design process. The timeline for completing this checklist depends on my availability, as I am doing this in my spare time. If I were working with an actual client, the pace would be much faster.

## 📝 Project Requirements – Sootheosaur

### 📌 Overview

Sootheosaur Spa is a fictional, humorous mobile app and desktop website concept that combines playful prehistoric themes with modern UX/UI principles. The app offers a fun experience where users can book stone-age inspired spa treatments like rock massages or dino foot baths. This project showcases creative mobile interface design for a fictional startup while maintaining real-world usability.

## ✅ Weekly Progress Checklist

Each week will have its own subfolder documenting what was done. This helps track progress clearly and keeps things organized.

Each subfolder contains a `README.md` that documents the work done that week in a **blog-style format**—including ideas, challenges, screenshots, and design decisions. This is not just a plan, but a running record of the actual design journey.
