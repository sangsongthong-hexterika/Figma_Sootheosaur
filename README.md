# Figma Project: Sootheosaur

## Disclaimer

This document outlines a checklist for my personal project showcasing my skills in Figma UI/UX design. The project is based on a fictional spa resort called Sootheosaur, designed to simulate a real-world client request for a responsive spa website.

The project includes:

+ Account registration and login flows
+ A reservation table system
+ A responsive mobile interface that differs from the desktop version

Currently, this project focuses only on the design, not the development or coding.

This is unpaid work, created solely to build a strong portfolio and demonstrate my detailed, organized design process. The timeline for completing this checklist depends on my availability, as I am doing this in my spare time. If I were working with an actual client, the pace would be much faster.
